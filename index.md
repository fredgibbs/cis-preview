This semester’s class project asked students to **trace the hidden histories of Southwest foods**—and to use every storytelling gadget in the Xanthan toolbox. The result? Three scroll-friendly essays that double as demos for figures, pull quotes, scrolly backgrounds, and carousels.

What you’ll find:
- Nachos: the 1943 border-café improvisation that became America’s most democratic snack
- Chiles: how a Mesoamerican plant became the badge of Southwestern identity (heat, pride, and capsaicin chemistry)
- Tamales: communal labor, ritual calendars, and why wrapped food still feels sacred

**Steal this project for your class:** swap in your own topic, keep the layouts, and let students focus on research, writing, and playful presentation. Everything below is editable; the card grid links directly into the essays.
